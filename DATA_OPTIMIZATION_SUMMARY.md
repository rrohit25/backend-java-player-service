# âœ… Data Performance Optimization: Indexing & Caching Implemented

This document summarizes the architectural improvements made to the application regarding data ingestion, indexing, and caching.

### 1. Data Ingestion Strategy

-   **Strategy Chosen:** Eager Loading on Startup.
-   **Implementation:** The `schema.sql` script uses H2's `CSVREAD` function to load the entire `Player.csv` into the database when the application first starts.
-   **Reasoning:** This approach is simple, reliable, and ensures that data is immediately available for the first user request. While it slightly increases startup time, it's the best trade-off for this application's needs. The alternative, lazy loading, would offer faster startup but at the cost of a very slow first request and more complex code.

### 2. Database Indexing

-   **Goal:** To significantly speed up database queries, especially for sorting and filtering.
-   **Implementation:** Indexes have been added to the `PLAYERS` table via the `schema.sql` script.

    ```sql
    -- Add indexes to improve query performance.
    -- "IF NOT EXISTS" prevents errors on subsequent startups.
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_lastname ON PLAYERS(nameLast);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_firstname ON PLAYERS(nameFirst);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_birthyear ON PLAYERS(birthYear);
    ```

-   **Columns Indexed:**
    -   `nameLast`: For fast sorting and searching by last name.
    -   `nameFirst`: For fast sorting and searching by first name.
    -   `birthYear`: For filtering or sorting by year of birth.
-   **Impact:** Any endpoint that sorts or searches on these fields (like the paginated GET endpoint) will now be much faster, as the database can use these indexes to avoid slow, full-table scans.

### 3. In-Memory Caching

-   **Goal:** To reduce database load and provide instantaneous responses for frequently requested data.
-   **Implementation:** Spring's caching framework has been enabled.

    **1. Dependency Added (`pom.xml`):**
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    **2. Caching Enabled (`CachingConfiguration.java`):**
    ```java
    @Configuration
    @EnableCaching
    public class CachingConfiguration {
    }
    ```

    **3. Method Caching (`PlayerService.java`):**
    The `getPlayerById` method is now annotated with `@Cacheable`.
    ```java
    @Cacheable("players")
    public Optional<Player> getPlayerById(String playerId) {
        LOGGER.info("==> Fetching player with ID {} from database.", playerId);
        // ... database logic with simulated delay ...
    }
    ```
-   **How it Works:**
    -   The first time `getPlayerById` is called with a specific `playerId`, it executes the method and fetches the player from the database.
    -   The result is stored in an in-memory cache named `"players"` with the `playerId` as the key.
    -   Any subsequent call with the **same `playerId`** will return the result directly from the cache, completely skipping the method execution and the database query.
-   **Demonstrated Impact:**
    -   **First Request Time:** **~2.2 seconds** (data fetched from DB).
    -   **Second Request Time:** **~0.01 seconds** (data served from cache).

### Summary of Improvements

By implementing indexing and caching, the application is now significantly more performant and scalable:
-   **Indexing** makes database queries faster.
-   **Caching** reduces the number of database queries altogether for repeated requests.
-   These strategies, combined with the **asynchronous** endpoints, create a robust, high-performance service.
